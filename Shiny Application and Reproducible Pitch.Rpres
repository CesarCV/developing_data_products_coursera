Introduction
========================================================

- The following Shiny Application was built for the course: **Developing Data Products** as part of the Coursera Data Science Specialization.
- The shiny app developed for this assignment is avalilable in the following link: https://m/
- The source code of ui.R and server.R are available on the my GitHub repository: https://githu

Description of the application
========================================================

- The application is a **Sample Size Calculator**.
- You can use it to estimate a sample size for a given population and other parameters, such as margin of error, confidence level, response distribution and expected non response rate.
- It uses the standard formulas for estimation of sample size for proportions, as shown in the next slide.
- The application is based on the sample size calculator of Raosoft (http://www.raosoft.com/samplesize.html). The application adds an expected non response rate and a plot to find margin of errors for a given sample size.

Formulas
========================================================

The formulas used in this application are the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
 x & = Z_{(c/100)}^{2}r(100-r) \\
 n & = N\frac{x}{(N-1)E^2 + x} \\
 E & = \sqrt{\frac{(N - n)x}{n(N-1)}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Where: $N$ is the population size, $r$ is the fraction of responses that you are interested in, and $Z(c/100)$ is the critical value for the confidence level $c$.

Future improvements
========================================================

- Better user interface.
- Add Power Analysis.
- Allow for more complex sample designs, such as stratified and clusters.
